My iPad2 swallowed Grandpa
Yes honestly, its true.
He pressed <Ctrl> and <Enter>
And disappeared from view.

It's devoured him completely
The thought just makes me squirm.
Maybe he's caught a virus
Or been eaten by a worm.

I've searched through the [Recycle Bin]
And files of every kind.
I've even used the Internet
But nothing could I find.

I asked Google in desperation
My searches to refine.
The reply from him was negative
Not a thing was found online.

So, if someday in your [Inbox]
My Grandpa you should see.
Please [Scan], [Copy] and [Paste] him
In an e-mail back to me.
