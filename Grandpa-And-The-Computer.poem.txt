The computer swallowed Grandpa
Yes honestly, its true.
He pressed 'control' and 'enter'
And disappeared from view.

It's devoured him completely
The thought just makes me squirm.
Maybe he's caught a virus
Or been eaten by a worm.

I've searched through the recycle bin
And files of every kind.
I've even used the internet
But nothing could I find.

I asked Jeeves in desperation
My searches to refine.
The reply from him was negative
Not a thing was found online.

So, if someday in your 'InBox'
My Grandpa you should see.
Please 'Scan', 'Copy' and 'Paste' him
In an e-mail back to me.
