I wonder what the camera really sees            /* I wonder (something you are actually curious about) */
I hear the buzzing bee                          /* I hear (an imaginary sound) */
I see flowers in early morning light            /* I see (an imaginary sight) */
I want to stop time in a box                    /* I want (an actual desire) */

I pretend to be a statue                        /* I pretend (something you pretend to do) */
I feel the shakes inside                        /* I feel (a feeling about something imaginary) */
I touch the shutter button                      /* I touch (an imaginary touch) */
I worry about the blurry result                 /* I worry (something that really bothers you) */

I understand moments in time                    /* I am (the first line of the poem repeated) */
I say let's freeze them forever                 /* I say (something you believe in) */
I dream of watercolor effects coming to life    /* I dream (something you actually dream about) */
I try to see all the soft muted edges           /* I try (something you make an effort to do)  */
I hope it happens someday                       /* I hope (something you actually hope for) */
